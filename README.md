# Smart Waste Management Robot 

This project is a Python simulation of an AI-powered robot designed to help solve urban waste challenges. The environment is a user-defined grid (3x3, 4x4, or 5x5) where waste locations are marked. The robot navigates the grid, automatically finding and cleaning waste in the most efficient order.

Key features include:
- User input for grid size, waste coordinates, and robot starting position
- Dynamic grid display showing clean cells (0), waste (1), and robot position (2)
- Robot moves optimally to the nearest waste cell, cleans it, and repeats until the grid is fully clean
- Real-time updates after each action and a final message confirming cleanup completion

This project demonstrates autonomous agent design, grid navigation logic, and AI-inspired problem-solving with an environmental focus.
